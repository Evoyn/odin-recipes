    <h4>What is bakso?</h4>
    <p>Bakso is a beloved Indonesian dish, famous for its savory meatballs served in a flavorful broth. Made from a
        mixture of finely ground beef or chicken combined with tapioca flour, the meatballs are chewy and tender,
        creating a satisfying texture. These meatballs are typically served with a clear, aromatic soup flavored with
        garlic, shallots, and spices, often garnished with fried shallots, fresh scallions, and a squeeze of lime for
        added zest.</p>
    <p>The dish is usually accompanied by rice noodles or yellow egg noodles, and sometimes tofu, hard-boiled eggs, or
        fried dumplings. Bakso is often enjoyed as street food or a comforting meal at home. With its warm, hearty
        flavors, it has become a favorite comfort food for Indonesians and food lovers around the world.</p>
